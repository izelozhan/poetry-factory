## Getting Started

First modify .env.local file and enter your API credentials for Weaviate.
To create a collection and load data in it, run:

```bash
npm run startup
```

To run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
